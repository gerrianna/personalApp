		{{#if showGuac}}
			Recipe:
			<br>
			3 medium avocados or 4 small ones
			<br>
			1 firm tomato, finely diced
			<br>
			1/2 white onion
			<br>
			1/2 cup chopped cilantro
			<br>
			2 tbsp fresh lemon or lime juice
			<br>
			Optional salt and pepper to taste
			<br>
			<br>
			Instructions:
			<br>
			1. Open the avocados and scoop out the flesh. An easy way is to cut it length-wise around the pit and than using a chefs knife strike the pit and then twist the knife so you can easily remove the pit and scoop out the flesh.
			<br>
			2. Mash the flesh with a fork, it can still have hard parts, follow your preference.
			3. Stir the other ingredients.
			<br>
			4. Enjoy right away or store in the refrigerator. A trick is to put a plastic wrap that touches the guacamole so it doesnâ€™t brown because of contact with air.
